                <h4>Greetings to the SAP North America Academic Community (SAPNAAC),</h4>
                <p>We hope that you and yours are well. With this message, we would like to introduce you to the new SAP
                    University Alliances North America Academic Board that has been working to define a means for
                    faculty to get more out of their University Alliances membership and to strengthen our relationship
                    with SAP and industry. We are excited about the opportunities available to our community. We have
                    developed a perpetual board membership which allows for one third of the board to change each year.
                    </hp>
                <p>Here are the Academic Board members for 2022-2023. </p>
