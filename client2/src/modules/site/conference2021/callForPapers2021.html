            <p>The research committee of SAPNAAC is seeking paper presentations on emerging technology, including
                Blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. Distributed Ledger
                Technologies (DLT) and blockchain (the technology behind Bitcoin) are currently disrupting multiple
                industries, including the financial sector. Financial tech has already seen applications of blockchain
                and DLT in high-frequency and algorithmic trading, digital securities, peer-to-peer lending, and
                cross-boundary payment systems, for example.</p>
            <p>IoT allows devices to send data to private blockchain networks. Such data is then used to create tamper-resistant records of shared transactions. By leveraging these new protocols, enterprises can enable secure, trust-less messaging between devices in an IoT network.  AI systems often use the trove of data generated by IoT devices to predict and optimize various business processes. AI has found application in various areas, from learning optimization, driverless cars, healthcare to drones. Despite the proliferation of AI systems, most problems are often solved through human beings and computers working cooperatively. Thus, Intelligence Augmentation (IA) is also equally important. Further, Robotic Process Automation (RPA) via tools such a UIPath. Celonis has also risen to prominence to discover and address bottlenecks in the business processes and supply chains. Papers that span or integrate blockchain, IoT, RPA, and AI systems or address them individually are encouraged. The track is also interested in research on continuously changing cloud computing platforms that support and implement these emerging technologies. We also encourage papers that address these emerging areas in the context of an enterprise system. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:</p>

            <ul style="margin-top:10px;">
                <li>AI biases in prediction</li>
