    All research papers will be double-blind peer-reviewed. They will be shared in the conference proceedings after being presented. Proceedings from prior conferences can be found in the SAPNAAC Library.  Additionally, each track will host a best paper award to recognize the top contributors. Note that all papers are to be submitted as an extended abstract no later than August 1st, 2021. Authors will receive notification of acceptance by August 16, 2021. They will be expected to have camera-ready final submissions ready for September 1, 2021.
Paper submissions should follow this template and be submitted to the most suitable of the four research tracks available (described below). <span class="underline">Please do not include the authors' name in the initial extended abstract submission, but use the placeholder if the paper is accepted and authors are asked to submit a camera-ready version.</span></p>
