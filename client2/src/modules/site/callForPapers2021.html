    <p>The SAP North America Academic Community (SAPNAAC) is seeking proposals for presentations on a variety of topics
        exploring new technologies and issues in enterprise systems from multiple perspectives including fundamental
        research, practice-oriented cases, emerging research, and teaching enterprise systems in higher education. The
        conference is organized by members of the SAP University Alliances in North America with the purpose to advance
        knowledge sharing, collaboration, communication, and community-building among like-minded faculty, graduate
        students and industry partners.</p>
    <p>In past years, the conference was associated with Train-the-Trainer SAP UA workshops. This yearâ€™s conference will
        be held online September 11-12, 2021. We will also coordinate joint events with colleagues in the SAP Academic
        Board DACH in Europe for new opportunities to foster a growing global network focused on innovation in research,
        teaching and practice in enterprise systems.</p>
    <p>Paper submissions should follow the template and be submitted to the most suitable of the 5 research tracks
        available. All research papers will be double-blind peer-reviewed, and they will be shared in the conference
        proceedings after being presented. Additionally, each track will host a best paper award to recognize the top
        contributors. Note that all papers are to be submitted as an extended abstract no later than July 9, 2021.
        Authors will receive notification of acceptance by August 9, 2021. They will be expected to have camera-ready
        final submissions ready for September 1, 2021.</p>
    <p>In addition to the research paper tracks, as track 6, we are hosting Teaching, Research, Education, and Diversity
        (TRED) Talks, which will accept 1-page proposals for shorter presentations until August 15. Submissions to the
        TRED Talks will be editorially reviewed, and published in the proceedings as 1-page abstracts.</p>

            <p>The research committee of SAPNAAC is seeking paper presentations on emerging technology, including
                Blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. Distributed Ledger
                Technologies (DLT) and blockchain (the technology behind Bitcoin) are currently disrupting multiple
                industries, including the financial sector. Financial tech has already seen applications of blockchain
                and DLT in high-frequency and algorithmic trading, digital securities, peer-to-peer lending, and
                cross-boundary payment systems, for example.</p>
            <p>IoT allows devices to send data to private blockchain networks. Such data is then used to create tamper-resistant records of shared transactions. By leveraging these new protocols, enterprises can enable secure, trust-less messaging between devices in an IoT network.  AI systems often use the trove of data generated by IoT devices to predict and optimize various business processes. AI has found application in various areas, from learning optimization, driverless cars, healthcare to drones. Despite the proliferation of AI systems, most problems are often solved through human beings and computers working cooperatively. Thus, Intelligence Augmentation (IA) is also equally important. Further, Robotic Process Automation (RPA) via tools such a UIPath. Celonis has also risen to prominence to discover and address bottlenecks in the business processes and supply chains. Papers that span or integrate blockchain, IoT, RPA, and AI systems or address them individually are encouraged. The track is also interested in research on continuously changing cloud computing platforms that support and implement these emerging technologies. We also encourage papers that address these emerging areas in the context of an enterprise system. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:</p>

            <ul style="margin-top:10px;">
                <li>AI biases in prediction</li>

                <li>AI applications in logistics, supply chain, workplace communication, HR</li>
                <li>Blockchain and distributed ledger technology in enterprises </li>
                <li>Fintech business models and analytics</li>
                <li>Cryptocurrencies and digital money/ Initial Coin Offering (ICO)/ Securitized Token Offering (STO)
