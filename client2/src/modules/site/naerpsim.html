            <h4>About the Game</h4>
            <p>ERPsim Business Simulation Game: Manufacturing Extended</p>
            <p>The ERPsim Manufacturing Game is a live ERP simulation game with a SAP S/4HANA and consists of producing
                and selling Muesli breakfast cereals to the German market</p>
            <p>During the game, the teams have to run a business in a make-to-stock manufacturing supply chain context
                and must interact with suppliers and customers by sending and receiving orders, delivering their
                products, and completing the whole end-to-end business cycle. </p>
            <p>ERPsim automates the sales process such that each firm receives many orders every round of the
                simulation. Several administrative functions in SAP are automated too, so that teams can focus on making
                business decisions, rather than mastery of the many transactions of a complex ERP system. Using a mix of
                the ERP systemâ€™s standard transactions and customized reports, students must analyze information and
                make business decisions to ensure the profitability of their operations.</p>
            <p>Company valuation is determined by profit and credit rating.</p>
            <p>The company with the highest company value at the end of the simulation wins the game!</p>
