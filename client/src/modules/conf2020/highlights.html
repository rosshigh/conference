      <div style="margin-top:10px;">We are introducing a new way to participate at the SAP UA conference with TRED
        Talks, inspired by the TREO
        talks at ICIS and TED talks. You will submit a one page abstract that will be editorially reviewed for fit with
        the conference theme and once accepted you will have a 10 minute presentation that will be submitted the week
        before the talk so we can build a rapid fire program of exciting and interesting ideas how to promote Teaching,
        Research, Education or Diversity in the SAP University Alliances. TRED Talk slides will be publically shared
        after the conference on the Conference website to inspire the broader community and find partners to innovate
        with.
